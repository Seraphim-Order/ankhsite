# The Professions, an introduction

![From left-to-right: Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Necromancer, Mesmer, Elementalist, Assassin, Ritualist, Paragon, and Dervish.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/2/2e/All_Profession_line.png "The 10 professions of Guild Wars.")

Ahai Seraphim,

This guide is a short introduction in the 10 unique professions (or 'classes') of Guild Wars.\
Several of these may seem familiar from playing Guild Wars 2, but it is important to note that these comparisons may be like night and day. \
Below, you'll find a list of the professions split by campaign (expansion) and some information on what defines these professions.

Professions in Guild Wars define the skillset, (primary) attributes, and appearance of your character, and as such are an important component in ensuring you will enjoy the game. In contrast to the professions in Guild Wars 2, you may choose a **primary** profession **and** a **secondary** profession.

Whereas Guild Wars 2 uses a system of specializations and traits, Guild Wars 1 uses **attributes**. \
Every profession has a selection of attributes unique to them, such as the ranger's Marksmanship and Beast Mastery enhancing bow use and the use of animal companions in combat respectively. Additionally, every profession as a **primary attribute**. The primary attribute is a unique attribute that you only gain access to depending on your choice of primary profession.\
Spending points on an attribute increases the effectiveness of skills bound to that attribute, spending points on a primary attribute does so as well while also granting a separate profession-unique benefit.\
Be sure to pay attention to attribute requirements of weapons and insignias. If you don't meet the required amount of points in the specified attribute, the effectiveness of the item is halved.

Armour in guild wars only determines your defenses and do not provide any other stats.\
Insignias and Runes can, however, be applied to the armour to enhance their effectiveness.\
Insignias generally give special benefits such as increases health, energy or defense; whereas runes generally increase health or attributes. (Be careful with the latter, however, as more powerful runes will require you to sacrifice a portion of your total health in order to boost your attributes!)\
\
Let's begin.

## The core professions.

The 'core' professions are the 6 professions that you may choose to play regardless of what campaign is your character's starting point. When choosing **Prophecies** as your starting campaign, you are limited solely to these core professions.\
The core professions are: **Warrior**, **Ranger**, **Monk**, **Necromancer**, **Mesmer**, and **Elementalist**.

### The Warrior 

![Warrior Icon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/8/88/Warrior-tango-icon-200.png)

The master of martial weapons, the warrior, is a heavily armoured tank using its high armour rating and powerful bursts to dominate the frontlines.

#### The warrior's attributes

* **Strength (Primary)**

  Strength is the warrior's primary (and therefore unique) attribute, it enhances their capability to penetrate their opponents' armour. Every rank increases armor penetration by 1% meaning that every rank allows the warrior to ignore 1% of their enemies armour rating.\
  Additionally, shields may depend on strength to be used effectively.\
  \
  If damage is what you seek, strength is your ally!
* **Axe Mastery**

  Axe Mastery increases the damage dealt using axes and their critical hit chance. 

  Axes are the second fastest weapons of the warrior. They allow you to dish out big hits and apply effects such as deep wound, a condition that reduces the enemies total health by 20%.
* **Hammer Mastery**

  Hammer Mastery increases the damage dealt using hammers and their critical hit chance.

  While hammers are the slowest weapons in the warrior's native arsenal, they also deal the highest damage on each succesful hit and grant access to (AoE) knockdowns.\
  Note that hammers are two-handed weapons, and as such require you to sacrifice your shield, making you more vulnerable on the battlefield.
* **Swordsmanship**

  Swordsmanship increases the damage dealt using swords and their critical hit chance.

  Swords are the fastest of the warrior's weapons and focus on dealing basic damage, applying bleeding, and on crippling the enemy providing constant pressure until their enemy enters Grenth's embrace.
* **Tactics**

  Tactics is the warrior's attribute that is more support and utility oriented. \
  Whereas skills tied to strength share several similarities from a selfish point of view, tactics puts emphasis on allowing you to use skills (such as shouts) that enhance the effectiveness of your party.\
  Additionally, shields may depend on tactics to be used effectively.

#### The warrior's armour

The warrior's armour is among the most powerful armours in the game, if not the most powerful.

With a base rating of 80 (note: casters have a base rating of 60, and medium classes of 70) and an additional 20 extra armour against physical damage, the warrior is able to withstand a lot of pressure.

Additionally, they've got access to skills, insignias and runes that enhance their armour rating even more, or decrease the incoming damage.

An example of this is the **stonefist insignia** that allows you to increase the duration of knockdowns you cause. 

#### General playstyle suggestions

Warriors are tanks and excel at being the center of the enemies' attention withstanding everything that is thrown at them. While taking the center stage they are far from mere damage sponges, however, as they have several tools at their disposal to disable enemies, wear them down slowly, to deal massive AoE damage, or even to take out that single pesky enemy preventing your team from attaining victory!

#### Secondary profession suggestions

Warriors are great primary professions but in compensation of all their strengths, they've been penalized with the smallest energy pool in the game on top of which they also have the slowest energy regeneration. \
Warriors circumvent this penalty by focusing on skills that cost adrenaline, a resource that builds up during combat with each hit dealt and taken.\
\
This does mean however that professions that rely on skills that cost a lot of energy are often poor choices for a warrior's secondary profession.\
A non-optimal choice is -however- not a death sentence, and secondary professions can always be changed.\
Be sure to experiment and who knows, you may find just the build for you in a place you'd never expect to look.

* **Warrior/Paragon**

  The Paragon, like the warrior, has a lot of adrenaline-related skills and skills to enhance their party. The sole difference between a tactics warrior and a paragon is mostly that the paragon is often found at range and to be trading in their offensive capabilities for defensive/supportive ones. \
  A warrior/paragon can make the best out of the paragon's spear and often deal great damage from range.

  It's worth mentioning as well that the paragon skill 'enduring harmony' allows the warrior to doubles the length of their selfish shouts, often greatly enhancing their use in combat.
* **Warrior/Ranger**

  The Ranger grants access to pets, doubling the warrior's presence on the frontlines, and grants access to some cheap condition applications to further enhance pressure (mostly) in sword-focused playstyles.

  Being a secondary ranger also allows you to counter elemental damage more easily, and potentially even gain infinite energy by doing so!
* **Warrior/Assassin**

  The Assassin has several signets and cheap energy skills that can be weaved into the warriors skillset. The sustain-focused skills of the assassin are especially helpful, as are the shadowsteps to immediately jump into the enemy and be sure they focus their fire on you, rather than your party.
* **Warrior/Dervish**

  While many Dervish skills have a high energy requirement, they do have a large number of adrenaline-fueled scythe attacks. These attacks are very strong on a warrior as they allow the warrior to attack three enemies at once with powerful hits!
* **Warrior/Mesmer**

  The Mesmer secondary grants the warrior access to powerful defensive stances and sources of energy management, while also providing several signets that are free to cast, yet still very effective.
