Ahai Seraphim and potential future Seraphim,\
below you'll find an overview of what we, as a guild, offer:

**What do we offer?**

  Ankh is a casual guild with a laid-back view on the game itself, focusing more on creating a communty than on efficiency in-game.
  
  Our members often study, have a job, or are otherwise occupied throughout the day or week; preventing them from being active on a daily basis. Therefore [Ankh] is a guild that prioritizes life outside of games above all. 

We use Discord or in-game chats to stay in touch, have guild meetings, and gather-up in-game regularly.

  We'd like to welcome you by offering the following:

* A relaxed, stress-free, and welcoming, environment within the Guild,  

* Play as you want/no *forced* “Meta-builds” playstyle,  
(further explained below.)

* Instanced PvE Content (Dungeons, Fractals, Strike Missions, Raids*),

* General PvE, Meta-events, and Map Completion,

* Personal Story, Living World

* PvE Guild Missions and other community events/challenges,

* Achievements, 

* Small-scale WvW,

* Guild interaction outside of the game such as casual chats and (board)game nights.


( * **Note:** We are not a raid-oriented guild. Although we have people interested in that type of content and story, it is not our main priority whatsoever. If you're looking for a guild with the sole purpose of raiding, other guilds may better suit your needs.)

**Important Notice:**  
  No matter if you're a veteran or new to the game,  
  we won’t force you into a certain playstyle.  
  Be it your time spent online, representing the guild or playing a certain build, etc.  
  It’s all up to yourself.  
  We give our members the freedom to **Play as they want.**  

  This means the following:


* **Time spent online:**  
  We understand many have their lives to live and families to care for. It’d be insane if we’d get mad because your in-laws showed up, if you had to pay additional attention to your study, or if your son/daughter just woke up from their nap.  
  Once you're a part of the guild you will be able to take breaks of up to **2 months.**  
  *(After 2 months of absence you'd receive a kick including a mail stating the reason why + an invitation back if you decide to return to the game. Once a Seraphim, always a Seraphim.)*  
  
  If you're expecting a break to last longer than 2 months we'll give you a retired rank to extend this period.  
  **Family and real life always come first.** 

* **Guild representation:**  
  We're aware several guilds require 100% representation, **we don’t.**  
  *Back in the day when Guild Influence as currency was a major thing representation was desired. This system is outdated and has been replaced with favor. You can still use the Guild’s chat, play with us, see who’s online etc. whilst representing another guild.*  
  
* **Play as you want:**  
  If you’ve always wanted to play a dual dagger necromancer, an elementalist, a hammer guardian or whatever. We’ll gladly give you the chance to.  
  **We do not hate or dislike the meta, we simply don’t live by it.**  
  This means that we **do allow** meta-builds, if this is what the individual player desires.  
  We heavily discourage methods such as Line of Sight-Stacking and one-shotting bosses.  
  Furthermore, we'll gladly offer you any constructive feedback on your desired build or playstyle for a character, if you so desire.  
  We support creativity.

* **Out-of-game interaction:**  
  We do not ask you to register on forums or any other websites, nor is the use of voice chat mandatory.For those who'd like to interact with our members throughout the day or whilst playing other games, a Discord chat is provided.
  If you're interested in joining in on more challenging content we do advise to at least listen as typing strategies mid-fight can be somewhat difficult.  
  
* **The expansions are not required:**  
  However, not having the expansions would limit you in some of the guild content.
  Although a lot of fun is to be had in the mainland of Tyria, sometimes we like to play in expansion-related content.  

* **No strong cores within the community**  
  Our intention is to offer a welcoming environment for any members old, and new.  
This means that every member should feel able and motivated to join any [Ankh] activity going on within the guild. You're welcome to play by yourself, and to form your own group of friends, but we do not support the formation of strong cores within the guild that only play together or allow certain members to join in. If you are a part of [Ankh], you are welcome in all content. (i.e. we strive to prevent excessive gatekeeping.)  

 <sup>(Note: 'play as you want' does not mean that you can freely troll around at the expense of others. The concept of 'play as you want' goes for everyone, and if you're simply not enjoyable to play with (excessive trolling, forcing people to play your way, etc.) (then others are not forced to play with you.)</sup>

**[Ankh] resides on Vabbi for World vs World purposes.**

In WvW we roam around together with a small group of people on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

While a system of megaservers allows all players on European servers to play PvE and PvP together, members would have to choose Vabbi as their server if they'd like to play WvW with the guild.

*Note that alliances are coming to Guild Wars 2 later [this year](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/arenanet-studio-update-july-2021/), which would allow any members of the guild to play WvW together regardless of what server they had chosen during the creation of their account.*

**Quality over Quantity**  
  One of our goals is to focus on the quality of our Guild and its members, not the quantity.  
  We’d rather recruit a single kind player who has just begun the game and doesn’t know anything about Tyria than a group of 10 trolls looking to spoil the experience for others.

  We have a rough limit of **100 members. (counting all ranks)**  
  We believe this keeps the guild active enough whilst allowing players to be away for up to 2 months.  
  
We want to create a casual and welcoming environment, not one where people feel forced to log on because they otherwise get demoted to a kick-list or even straight-up kicked.

**If you’d like a Guild of limited size, yet active enough to do PvE, PvP, and WvW-content with, we hope you’ll feel at home with us.**

**Why are we recruiting?**

The pandemic has hit us all quite hard, and not everyone has been able to continue guild interactions, especially in-game.

We value the time our members spend on their lives outside the game and would rather see you log on for a bit to unwind, than see your progress at your study or job deteriorate because of a game. This mindset has, over the years, attracted mostly those with steady jobs or studies, and naturally they cannot play all day, every day.  

  The guild is not inactive, but being a small community as we are, we meet certain limitations. Activity fluctuates and because of this certain forms of group content can end up being difficult to organize solely for guild members.

As such, we'd like for you to bolster our ranks!

***TL;DR*** We simply wish to boost our activity and play all content with people with similar mindsets. 


Thank you for your time,

  -Nero, Rav, Femke, and the entirety of the Order.
